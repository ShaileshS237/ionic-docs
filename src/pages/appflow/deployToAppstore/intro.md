Ionic Appflow's Deploy To Appstore feature allows you to send your app to the Apple Appstore and the Google Play store entirely in the cloud.
Push changes to the app store from anywhere, any platform.

We've enabled the early access version of our Deploy to App Store features for your Appflow account. Currently, the feature is only supported in build create manuallyâ€”via logging into the dashboard and creating a new build. We are adding support for deploying builds from Automations, as well as builds triggered from the Ionic CLI.

We now support 2 new destinations which you can create by navigating to the `Destinations` tab located under the `Deploy` tab.

You can create a new destination now and choose from `Web Deploy Channel` (Live Updates Channel) `Apple App Store` or `Google Play`.
